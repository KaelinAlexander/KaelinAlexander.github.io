For my last Bootcamp Blog, I’d like to take some time to reflect by breaking down some of what I learned about learning about coding. In that vein, and in the interest of helping folks grok some of the more anxiety-inducing aspects of a Coding Bootcamp, I’ve broken things down into three major domains: labs, projects, and cohort.

**Labs**

Early on, labs were a much greater time-sink than I anticipated. Why?

Well, first and foremost, the imperative to complete all of them for FIS’ First Mile is no joke; it’s stress-inducing, and if you aren’t much of a completionist (outside of completing the National Dex at the start of quarantine), then the prospect of barreling through everything is daunting.

After First Mile, though, I’ll let you in on a little secret: labs are optional. I don’t suggest blowing them off, by any means: I would not have succeeded on projects had I not worked through the vast majority of labs. However, I also got in the habit of setting ground rules for myself:

1. **Set reasonable time limits for labs.** If you’re still stuck over an hour into a lab with 10 tests or fewer, then odds are good that you simply need more exposure to the content you’re being tested on. 

Just like reading Lacan (which no one should do), sometimes in Bootcamp it’s best simply to keep going when something doesn’t make sense. Odds are good that, after the next lab or readme, you’ll be much better prepared to tackle an earlier lab. Double-back to it when you feel like you know what you’re doing.

2. **Learn the difference between productive and unproductive frustration.** It’s 1000% alright that frustration is designed into Bootcamp curricula. Negative emotions are valuable, plain and simple, and frustration for me serves as an index of my limits. Actually knowing the limits of my knowledge is an incredible gift because it suggests where and how I need to grow.

At the same time, though, frustration is also often a sign that I need to look outside the limits of my own proverbial archive. If, as sometimes happens, Bootcamp curricula simply doesn’t seem to equip you with the knowledge you need to solve a problem, then don’t keep looking at your Bootcamp’s documentation. There are incredible, brilliant, accessible tutorials on almost any coding concept. Look those up and try again. YouTube is a first option, not a last resort, for when I get stuck.

3. **Check for missing returns, weird closures, modified datatypes, and lost arguments.** It really is that simple most of the time.

4. **Is this a fight worth having?** Towards the end of my program, testing frameworks started to behave a bit erratically, or simply didn’t fire up at all. Sometimes this was actually pointing to a syntax error (without telling me as much), but sometimes errors simply aren’t worth solving.

Did you build out the deliverable, such that it works as described in the spec? Cool, then you’re done. No light changing from yellow to green is going to be worth the extra half hour it might take me to get all tests to pass. If the app behaves like it should, then call it good.

**Projects**

Projects were actually my favorite part of my Bootcamp experience. They meant focusing on features, rather than clearing tests, and gave me an opportunity both to affirm and reinforce what I’d learned and challenge myself to push even farther.

That being said, early on I was super intimidated by projects because they often relied on knowledge I’d only just learned, and had barely seen put to the test. So, to mitigate that sense of being caught off-guard, I finally developed some healthy project prep habits by the end of my Bootcamp:

1. **Review all of the group study lectures.** Due to my schedule, and time zone, I couldn’t easily attend group study over Zoom on a regular basis. But I still found value from recorded study groups in the last week of a module. 

Basically, I’d start the video sequence at the start of a module’s project; then, I’d take a couple hours every day to code along with the videos in full. This is actually a lot easier, and more thorough, than attempting to live code-along, which is a bit more frantic. By taking plenty of notes, I’d reaffirm what I’d learned over the course of the module.

2. **Watch outside video tutorials in the days prior to project launch.** Net Ninja seems to be the favorite of my cohort, and his approach to teaching coding is compelling, straightforward, and assumes an engaged, active, independent viewer—all things I like to be!

Again, the point isn’t just to watch, but rather to code along. This can be time intensive, but it usually means coming into the project with a nearly completed practice project. From this, assuming it works, you have a ready-made compare-and-contrast that will help you debug and make getting to MVP a lot faster. And speaking of MVP…

3. **MVP is YMMV.** Yeah, I know, “C’s Get Degrees,” and in the land of Bootcamp there isn’t really even a degree involved. There were definitely projects where meeting MVP (“minimum viable product”) was the goal, particularly when I came in feeling under-prepared or intimidated by the project.

That being said, challenging myself for a project took a lot of forms. Sometimes it meant going all-in with 6 models, other times it meant sticking with 1 model and then making a nice, responsive UI with decent styling. 
For my bibliography project, I knew that I wanted to leverage a library catalog’s API using a search feature. Did that take the lion’s share of 2 days to implement? Absolutely. Was it explicitly working towards MPV? Nope. Did it realize my Rails project’s proof of concept and teach me a hell of a lot about algorithms? Completely—which made the challenge, MVP or not, worth it.

Please, please stick to MVP if that’s what you have the capacity for in light of everything else going on in your life, and everything you know about your own approach to learning. But, for me, having challenges—big and small—made projects more than just cumulative; it made them expansive.

**Cohort**

If there was any portion of my Bootcamp experience that I wish I could Mulligan on, it’s the Cohort experience. Partly due to my time zones, partly due to my work schedule, I found keeping up with my Cohort, and developing relationships with my colleagues, to be a real challenge.

What’s incredible, though, is that for all of my sense that I should’ve given more, I also had some really genuinely wonderful connections with my colleagues. Moreover, even colleagues with whom I had little contact were total bros.
Almost every single day, I saw a cohort member whom I didn’t recognize pop up on Slack with a question, and then see another cohort member offer feedback or advice. Several times, I was totally at a loss for how to proceed with a project, but then a cohort member suggested a fix, or a resource, or even a simple “I’m having that problem too—it sucks.”

Simply knowing that I wasn’t going it alone, and was going it together with folks whose backgrounds and experiences are radically different from my own, made a huge difference in my Bootcamp journey.
So, while I have retroactive FOMO about Cohort Happy Hours I might have missed, I’m still super grateful with the sheer expertise and graciousness of the folks I studied with, however distantly.

**TTFN, Bootcamp**

Bootcamp might be ending, but my absolute favorite thing about coding is how much more I have yet to learn, and that there will simply always be more to learn in software engineering. I’ve already started a “Wishlist” for the languages and libraries to pick up next, and I’m leaving Bootcamp feeling empowered, energized, and maybe even a little self-actualized.
